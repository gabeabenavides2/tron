# Tron AI Game  

## Overview  
This project is a Tron game developed as a guided project through the **MSU AI Club**. The game allows players to compete against an AI opponent trained using reinforcement learning. The project was built using **Python** and **pygame**, incorporating AI decision-making to create a competitive gameplay experience.  

## Features  
- **Classic Tron Gameplay**: Navigate a grid-based arena while avoiding walls and trails.  
- **AI Opponent**: The AI is trained using reinforcement learning to make strategic decisions.  
- **Training Mode**: Train the AI using reinforcement learning.  
- **Player vs AI Mode**: Play against the AI to test its strategies.  

## How It Works  
- The AI is trained using reinforcement learning principles.  
- The game loop runs in **pygame**, rendering the grid and handling player/AI inputs.  
- The AI uses past training data to improve its movement decisions.  

## Project Timeline  
This project followed a structured development process over six weeks with resources from the **MSU AI Club**:
